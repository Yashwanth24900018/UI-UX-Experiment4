# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:

Design a wireframe diagram for a generic application or website using Balsamiq, including at least 5 essential screens/pages: Welcome/Splash Screen,

Login/Signup Screen, Home/Dashboard Screen, Content/Product Listing Screen, and Checkout/Contact/Final Action Screen.

## Algorithm:
```
Start

Open Balsamiq Wireframes tool or website.

    1.Create a new project and give it a suitable name (e.g., “Generic App Wireframe”).

   2. Design the following screens one by one:

    3.Welcome/Splash Screen – Add app logo, title, and a loading animation or “Get Started” button.

    4.Login/Signup Screen – Add input fields for username/email, password, and buttons for login/signup.

    5.Home/Dashboard Screen – Add navigation bar, icons, and key sections (like profile, notifications, etc.).

    6.Content/Product Listing Screen – Add image placeholders, product titles, and prices or brief descriptions.

    7.Checkout/Contact/Final Action Screen – Add summary details, form fields, and “Submit” or “Confirm” button.

 Arrange screens sequentially to show user flow (Welcome → Login → Home → Listing → Checkout).

Add navigation links or arrows between screens to represent interaction paths.

Review and refine the layout for usability and clarity.

Export all screens as images or PDF for submission.

End
